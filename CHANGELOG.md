# Changelog

All notable changes to **cast** are recorded here. Format inspired by
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); cast follows
semantic versioning (see `CLAUDE.md` → *Versioning*).

Each entry is keyed by the value of `version.Current`
(`internal/version/version.go`) at the time the change shipped. Newest
versions on top.

## [0.18.0] – 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **History tab is now full-width.** The left sidebar (commands in single
  mode, saved chains in chain mode) is hidden while the History tab is
  active so the runs table can use the freed horizontal space. The live
  output panel still renders on the right.

### Added

- **Re-run from the History table.** `↑`/`↓` move a row cursor (and `g`/`G`
  jump to top/bottom); `⏎` on a row re-runs that entry. In single mode it
  dispatches the highlighted command (auto-queues it if another run is in
  progress); in chain mode it replays the full saved chain. Targets
  removed from the Makefile show a status-bar notice instead of erroring.

## [0.17.2] – 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Library tab hints clipped off-screen** (real cause of the 0.17.1
  symptom). `renderLibraryList` was packing each two-line card into a
  single slice element joined by `\n`, while `padRows` reasoned in
  *element* count rather than *line* count. The list ended up rendering
  more lines than its `bodyH` budget, pushing the hint past the panel
  bottom; `fitFrame` then cropped it. `renderLibraryRow` now returns
  two separate strings (one per row) and the caller appends each as its
  own slice entry so element count == line count.

## [0.17.1] – 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Status bar disappears on narrow terminals.** When the header pills
  (notice + mode + env) plus the logo/tabs exceeded the terminal width,
  the wrapped header pushed everything below out of the viewport.
  `renderMain` now hard-fits the header, body, and status bar to their
  budgeted slots (`headerH`, `bodyH`, `statusH`) — over-wide lines are
  ANSI-truncated rather than wrapped, so the status bar is always
  visible regardless of terminal size.
- **Library tab hints not visible / off-style.** Replaced the single
  muted line with the same `[key] label` row style the sidebar uses
  (accent-bold key brackets + dim labels, packed greedily). Also fixed
  a 1-row off-by-one in the inner height budget so the hint row sits at
  the bottom of the panel without leaving a blank gap above the status
  bar.

## [0.17.0] – 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **Library tab is now full-width.** The sidebar (commands list) and the
  output panel are hidden while the library tab is active so the snippet
  list and preview have the whole terminal width.
- **Toast moved from the status bar to a header pill.** Internal events
  (snippet saved, theme persisted, etc.) now appear as a rounded-border
  pill on the right side of the header, immediately to the left of the
  mode pill (`SINGLE`/`CHAIN`). Severity glyphs: `✓` success (green),
  `⚠` error (red), `·` info (accent). Long messages truncate at 48
  columns; the pill auto-fades after 4 seconds.

## [0.16.1] – 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Snippet extraction was capturing `.PHONY` continuation lines instead
  of the real recipe** (regression in 0.16.0). When a Makefile declared
  `.PHONY: build run … \` followed by space-indented continuations,
  `findTargetIndex` matched a continuation line as the target itself and
  the saved `.mk` ended up empty (no recipe). Fixed by hardening
  `findTargetIndex` to reject any indented line and to require the name
  to appear as a whole token before the `:`. Regression test added.

## [0.16.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Snippets library** (`library` tab — the 5th tab). A per-user
  collection of reusable Makefile targets stored under
  `~/.config/cast/snippets/<name>.mk` (one file per snippet, plain Make).

  Usage:

  ```text
  ctrl+x   on a target in the commands tab → save it to the library
           (extracts the doc-line, target line and recipe verbatim)
  Tab→library  →  browse with fuzzy search and a side-by-side preview
  Enter   on a snippet  →  append to the current Makefile
                          (aborts with ErrTargetExists on conflict)
  d (×2)  on a snippet  →  delete the .mk file
  ```

  ```bash
  # The on-disk format is just plain Make:
  cat ~/.config/cast/snippets/deploy.mk
  ## deploy: Despliega un servicio [pick=services/*]
  deploy:
  	@./deploy.sh $(CAST_PICK_1)
  ```

- New keybinding `ctrl+x` (`KeyMap.ExtractSnippet`) — extracts the
  highlighted target to the global library.

- Public Makefile helpers in `internal/source/makefile.go`:
  `MakefileTargetLines`, `AppendMakefileTarget`, `ExtractMakefileTarget`,
  plus typed errors `ErrTargetExists` / `ErrTargetNotFound`.

## [0.15.5] – 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **TUI is now transparent over the terminal background.** All structural
  surfaces (panels, dividers, header bands, hint rows, pills) drop their
  explicit `Background()` so they show the user's terminal bg directly.
  Selection (`BgSelected`), shortcut/tag chips, and modal overlays remain
  opaque on purpose. Eliminates the multi-tone banding that was
  particularly visible on Nord.

## [0.15.4] – 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Unified all panel surfaces to `BgPanel` (output, detail, env, expanded
  popups). Previous mix of `BgPanel` / `BgDeep` / `Bg` produced visible
  horizontal stripes between header, term area, hint row, and RECENT.

## [0.15.3] – 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Output panel: replaced `BgDeep` with `BgPanel` everywhere so header,
  term, hint, and RECENT rows share one surface.

## [0.15.2] – 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Wrapped the entire frame in `Background(p.Bg)` and forced dividers to
  `Background(p.Bg)` so empty cells and `│` separators no longer show the
  terminal default colour through panel gaps.

## [0.15.1] – 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Nord theme:** `Border` (`#3B4252`) was identical to `BgPanel`,
  rendering every separator and rounded box invisible. Bumped to
  `#4C566A` (Nord polar-night-3).
- Env pill (`DEV/STG/PRD`) uses palette tokens (`p.Green`, `p.Orange`,
  `p.Red`) instead of hard-coded Catppuccin hex. Each theme now provides
  its own variant.

## [0.15.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Theme tab is fully implemented.** Live preview as you navigate; press
  `Enter` to persist `theme = "<name>"` in the local `.cast.toml`.

  ```toml
  # .cast.toml at the project root
  theme = "nord"
  ```

- New TOML field `theme` in `LocalFile`, plus `WriteLocalTheme(path,
  theme)` writer that preserves comments and other sections.

### Changed

- Config priority for `Theme`: CLI flag > local `.cast.toml` > global
  per-env override > global default.

## [0.14.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Confirm modal is keyboard-navigable.**

  ```text
  ←/→ or h/l   move focus between [cancel] and [confirm]
  tab          toggle
  ⏎            commit the focused button
  y            yes (direct hotkey)
  n / esc      no  (direct hotkey)
  ```

  Default focus is `confirm` so existing single-press `Enter` flows still
  work. The focused button shows a `▸` cursor and bold weight; the other
  reserves the same column so layout doesn't jump on movement.

## [0.13.2] – 2026-04-25

### Changed

- When a chain (≥2 steps) finishes — including auto-queued chains created
  via shortcuts while another command was running — the full intent
  (`chainCommands`) is now persisted as both the sequence record AND the
  rerun card target. `Ctrl+R` and the rerun card replay the entire chain,
  even if a middle step failed.

## [0.13.1] – 2026-04-25

### Changed

- **Per-project last-run state moved from `.cast.last.json` to SQLite.**
  New table `project_last_runs(project_dir, commands, extra_vars,
  updated_at)` keyed by absolute Makefile dir. Removed the file-system
  side-channel and its `.gitignore` entry.

## [0.13.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- Rerun card now supports **chains** in addition to single commands.
  Single dispatches show `↻ build · last command`; chains show
  `↻ a › b › c · last chain (3)`. `Ctrl+R` and `Enter` on the card
  replay the saved sequence.
- `state.LastRun` schema: `Commands []string` (replaces `Command
  string`), with backward-compat read for files written by 0.12.0.

## [0.12.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Pinned "rerun" card** at the top of the command sidebar with a yellow
  accent. Persists across CLI restarts so the first `Ctrl+R` after
  reopening cast in a project replays the last command without
  re-prompting.

  ```text
  ↑ from the first command  →  focus the rerun card
  ⏎ on the card             →  rerun (skips picker if extras cached)
  ```

## [0.11.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- `Ctrl+R` now repeats the last command, **including pick-typed
  commands** — the previous picker selections are reused, the modal does
  not reopen.

### Fixed

- `Ctrl+R` was being intercepted by the `Run/RunAlt` key case before
  reaching `RerunLast`. Re-ordered the switch so `RerunLast` wins when
  the bindings collide.

## [0.10.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Configurable icon set.** New `[ui] icons` field in
  `~/.config/cast/cast.toml`:

  ```toml
  [ui]
  icons = "nerdfont"   # default; "emoji" for terminals without Nerd Font
  ```

- Central `IconSet` registry in `internal/tui/views/icons.go`. Every new
  icon must be added here (Nerd Font codepoint canonical, emoji
  fallback) and consumed via `Icons(style).<Field>` — no inline glyphs
  in views.

## [0.9.0] – 2026-04-25

### Added

- **`[pick=...]` Makefile tag.** Opens a folder picker before running
  commands that require directory input. Each `*` is one picker step.

  ```make
  ## test:    Run Odoo tests           [pick=./*~addons/*] [as=ROOT,MOD]
  ## deploy:  Deploy a service         [pick=services/*]
  ## sync:    Two independent picks    [pick=./*~odoo; configs/*]
  test:
  	cd $(ROOT) && python -m pytest $(MOD)
  ```

  Selections are exposed both as Make variables (`$(CAST_PICK_1)` /
  `$(ALIAS)`) and as environment variables. Cancel with `esc`; `←` /
  empty-buffer backspace steps back to the previous pick. The picker is
  a fzf — type to filter — and rows show content-aware glyphs (Odoo
  modules, Git repos, Makefiles, `package.json`, …).
